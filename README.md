# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Project



### Overview


This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Coursera Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data" project.



### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The R script called *run_analysis.R* that does the following.


1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
